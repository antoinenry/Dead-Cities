Dead Cities
===========

This repository contains two version of a video game project.
- an older, C++ version
- a more recent version that uses Unity3D and C# scripts

A quick game description
------------------------
Dead Cities is a survival game set in randomly generated cities filled with hostile zombie-like creatures. The goal is to find survivors to gather and manage a team through the apocalypse.

Main features
-------------
- Randomly generated urban environment
- Ennemies with artificial intelligence to move in hords

Project Status
--------------
I've started working on a first version using C++ and OpenGL. It featured a pathfinding system allowing to move multiple characters at once in a static environment, and a good start in the AI system allowing ennemies to roam until they get interested in an open door or a human.
I've recently rebooted the project and started working with Unity3D. I've concentrated my effort on a randomly, dynamicaly generated map with streets, buildings and building interiors. I also had to adapt the pathfinding system. I hope to start working on the ennemies soon.

Ambition
--------
The final game will allow to move from cities to cities, with an increasing difficulty. The ultimate goal would be to study the hostiles in order to find the origin of the invasion, which will also be randomly chosen (virus, chemicals, mutations, alien parasites, malediction...). The player will get a score based on how he managed his survivor team.
